Description: Performs genomic prediction of hybrid performance using eight statistical methods including GBLUP, BayesB, RKHS, PLS, LASSO, EN, LightGBM and XGBoost along with additive and additive-dominance models. Users are able to incorporate parental phenotypic information in all methods based on their specific needs. (Xu S et al(2017) <doi:10.1534/g3.116.038059>; Xu Y et al (2021) <doi: 10.1111/pbi.13458>).
