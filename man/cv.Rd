  inbred_phe = NULL,
  y,
  method = "GBLUP",
  drawplot = TRUE,
  nfold = 5,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{fix}{a design matrix of the fixed effects.}

\item{gena}{a matrix (n x m) of additive genotypes for the training population.}

\item{gend}{a matrix (n x m) of domiance genotypes for the training population. Default is NULL.}

\item{inbred_phe}{a matrix (n x 2) of inbred_phe phenotypic.Default is NULL.}

\item{y}{a vector(n x 1) of the phenotypic values.}

\item{method}{eight GS methods including "GBLUP", "BayesB", "RKHS", "PLS", "LASSO", "EN", "XGBoost","LightGBM".
Users may select one of these methods or all of them simultaneously with "ALL". Default is "GBLUP".}

\item{drawplot}{when method ="ALL", user may select TRUE for a barplot about eight GS methods. Default is TRUE.}

\item{nfold}{the number of folds. Default is 5.}

\item{nTimes}{the number of independent replicates for the cross-validation. Default is 1.}

\item{seed}{the random number. Default is 1234.}

\item{CPU}{the number of CPU.}

\value{
Trait predictability
}
\description{
The cv function evaluates trait predictability based on eight GS methods via k-fold cross validation.
The trait predictability is defined as the squared Pearson correlation coefficient between the observed and the predicted trait values.

\examples{

## load example data from hypred package
data(hybrid_phe)
data(input_geno)

## convert original genotype
inbred_gen <- convertgen(input_geno, type = "hmp2")

##additive model infer the additive and dominance genotypes of hybrids
gena <- infergen(inbred_gen, hybrid_phe)$add
gend <- infergen(inbred_gen, hybrid_phe)$dom

##additive model
R2<-cv(fix=NULL,gena,gend=NULL,y=hybrid_phe[,3],inbred_phe=NULL,method ="GBLUP")

##additive-dominance model
R2<-cv(fix=NULL,gena,gend,y=hybrid_phe[,3],inbred_phe=NULL,method ="GBLUP")}
